## Introduction

This application was designed to showcase an age gate functionality that one would expect to encounter when visiting websites that require the user to confirm that they are 18 years of age or older. The example used in this application is the Brooklyn Brewery business. The application was built using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Functionality

The age gate is designed to take a month and day input from the user. When the values are entered the application saves this information and compares it with the current date to determine the user's current age. If their age is not 18 or older then the application will generate an error message informing the user that they are not old enough. The appplication is also designed to handle edge cases where the user does not enter a month and, or age and displays an error message informing the user to enter an appropriate value.
